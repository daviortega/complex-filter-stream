# complex-filter-stream

Filter out objects that don't match a series of filtering requirements.

##TL;DR


## Basic usage

```javascript
const complexFilterStream = require('complex-filter-stream')
const readableStream = getaReadableObjectModeStreamSomeHow()

const queryStack = [
	{
		"type": "filter",
		"not": false,
		"searchFor": "chocolate",
		"searchOn": "flavor",
		"searchType": "contains"
	}
]

const myFilter = complexFilterStream(queryStack)

readableStream.pipe(myFilter)
```

## How to build the queryStack.

`complex-filter-stream` is a `Transform` stream made out of a bundle of transform streams built based on a series of filtering requirements. They are passed to the stream as a json object.

### A simple filter

```json
[
	{
		"type": "filter",
		"not": false,
		"searchFor": "search string",
		"searchOn": "microscopist",
		"searchType": "contains"
	}
]
```

Notice that the `filter object` is part of an array. That is because `complex-filter-stream` let you stack filters. Now let's go through the specifics.

#### `type`

The `type` field can accept three values: `filter`, `AND` and `OR`. We will talk extensively about it soon enough.

#### `not`

The `not` field takes either `false` or `true`. If not present it defaults to `false`.

#### `searchFor`

The `searchFor` field takes what should be expected to see in the object for filter in.

#### `searchOn`

The `searchOn` field takes the fields of the object that will be filtered.

#### `searchType`

The `searchType` field is used to identify the type of filter it should be used. Currently, `complex-filter-stream` supports:

`contains`: passes if the value of `searchFor` matches anywhere in the `object[searchOn]`.  
`exact`: passes if the value of `searchFor` matches exactly the `object[searchOn]`.  
`startsWith`: passes if the value of `searchFor` matches the beginning of the `object[searchOn]`.  
`endsWith`: passes if the value of `searchFor` matches the end of the `object[searchOn]`.  
`regex`: passes if the `javascript` flavored `regex` in `searchFor` matches `object[searchOn]`.

There is also support for values:
`exactValue`: passes if the value of `searchFor` is exactly the value of `object[searchOn]`. 
`lessThan`: passes if the value of `object[searchOn]` is smaller than `searchFor`.
`greaterThan`: passes if the value of `object[searchOn]` is larger than `searchFor`.
`between`: passes if the value of `object[searchOn]` is in between two semi-colon separated values in `searchFor`.

> In this cases, NOT also works and invert the search intervals if `true`

### A complex filter.

Let's suppose that our objects to be filtered looks like this:

```json
{
	"date": 1161302400,
	"NBCItaxID": 80880,
	"speciesName": "Hylemonella gracilis",
	"tiltSingleDual": 1,
	"defocus": -12,
	"dosage": 75,
	"tiltConstant": 1,
	"tiltMin": -63,
	"tiltMax": 60,
	"tiltStep": 0.9,
	"microscopist": "Gavin Murphy",
	"institution": "Caltech",
	"lab": "Jensen Lab",
	"sid": "gm2006-10-20-4"
}
```

and we would like to filter in all objects with `NCBItaxID` as `80880` **AND** `microscopist` as `Gavin Murphy`.

To do that we need two filter requirements, let's see how to organize them:

```json
[
	{
		"type": "filter",
		"searchFor": 80880,
		"searchOn": "NCBItaxID",
		"searchType": "exact",
	},
	{
		"type": "filter",
		"searchFor": "Gavin Murphy",
		"searchOn": "microscopist",
		"searchType": "exact"
	}
]
```

so... the default association in `complex-filter-stream` is `AND`. As we add `type:filter` objects to the stack, they will be considered in sequence as in `AND` form.

Now, let's build a filter for objects with `NCBItaxID` as `80880` **AND** `microscopist` as `Gavin Murphy` **OR** `Matt Swulius`:

```json
[
	{
		"type": "filter",
		"searchFor": 80880,
		"searchOn": "NCBItaxID",
		"searchType": "exact",
	},
	{
		"type": "OR",
		"args": [
			{
				"type": "filter",
				"searchFor": "Gavin Murphy",
				"searchOn": "microscopist",
				"searchType": "exact"
			},
			{	"type": "filter",
				"searchFor": "Matt Suwlius",
				"searchOn": "microscopist",
				"searchType": "exact",
			}
		]
]
```

As we can see `complex-filter-stream` uses a different `type` of filter object to listen to associations.

Now, let's build a filter for objects with `NCBItaxID` as `80880` **AND** `microscopist` as `Gavin Murphy` **OR** `Matt Swulius`, but from all the objects with `Matt Swulius` let's only filter in the ones with `lab:"Jensen Lab"`:

```json
[
	{
		"type": "filter",
		"searchFor": 80880,
		"searchOn": "NCBItaxID",
		"searchType": "exact",
	},
	{
		"type": "OR",
		"args": [
			{
				"type": "filter",
				"searchFor": "Gavin Murphy",
				"searchOn": "microscopist",
				"searchType": "exact"
			},
			{
				"type": "AND",
				"args": [
					{	"type": "filter",
						"searchFor": "Matt Suwlius",
						"searchOn": "microscopist",
						"searchType": "exact",
					},
					{	"type": "filter",
						"searchFor": "Jensen Lab",
						"searchOn": "lab",
						"searchType": "exact",
					},
				]
			}
		]
	}
]
```

In this case, we had to *declare* another type of association (`AND`). So as a rule of thumb, everytime that there is a change in association type (`AND` or `OR`), a new `type` of association must be declared.


If we would like to make the `lab` requirement to all of them:

```json
[
	{
		"type": "filter",
		"searchFor": 80880,
		"searchOn": "NCBItaxID",
		"searchType": "exact",
	},
	{	"type": "filter",
		"searchFor": "Jensen Lab",
		"searchOn": "lab",
		"searchType": "exact",
	},
	{
		"type": "OR",
		"args": [
			{
				"type": "filter",
				"searchFor": "Gavin Murphy",
				"searchOn": "microscopist",
				"searchType": "exact"
			},
			{	"type": "filter",
				"searchFor": "Matt Suwlius",
				"searchOn": "microscopist",
				"searchType": "exact",
			}
		]
]
```
